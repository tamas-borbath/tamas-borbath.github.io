abstract: 'Most European adequacy assessments consider transmission constraints through fixed caps on power exchanges per border. This method fails to portray the flexibility introduced by modern market design, leading to incorrect final results. This paper investigates different cross-border capacity representations and proposes a way to model transmission constraints using the flow-based approach while accounting for the marketâ€™s adequacy relevant rules. Using the latest update of the IEEE Reliability Test System, a case study shows that the representation of the cross-border transmission constraints plays a primary role in resource adequacy, and representing them through detailed models is needed.'
