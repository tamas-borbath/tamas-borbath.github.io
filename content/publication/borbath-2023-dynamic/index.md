abstract: 'HVDC interconnectors connect two points of a power system, efficiently transmitting large amounts of power over large distances. These assets contain power electronic-based converters and often buried cables designed to enable the continuous transmission of a fixed nominal amount of power. However, some designs temporarily allow higher capacities. In this paper, we examine and investigate ways to maximize the economic value of these additional dynamic capacities. We show that significant economic gains can be achieved by offering the dynamic capacity to the market at the right moments. But, we found that these economic gains are hindered by the current market design restricting the optimal utilization of the assets.'
