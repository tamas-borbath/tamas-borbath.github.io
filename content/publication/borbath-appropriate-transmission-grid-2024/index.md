abstract: To manage power shortages, system operators must rely on involuntarily demand
  curtailment to keep the grid operational. Curtailment causes damages to consumers,
  the cost of which should be balanced against investments in a more reliable power
  system. To understand the behavior of the system and the expected character of shortages,
  we rely on resource adequacy studies. These studies provide a probabilistic quantitative
  framework by emulating system operation over many future years. However, the methods
  to emulate the power system must balance computational efficiency with accuracy
  and rely on different simplifications and approximations of the power system and
  its behavior. Here we show that the transmission model choice particularly impacts
  the results of these studies, especially for large systems where scarcity risk is
  shared through markets with significant inter-regional transmission capacities.
  Our results demonstrate that the most commonly used simple transmission grid models
  highly distort key adequacy metrics and are likely to cause the misinterpretation
  of system needs.
